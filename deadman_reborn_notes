DEADMAN REBORN PLAN

I'm considering playing a 70 Defense/Piety Pure. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Defence_Pure
Goal is learning PvP more efficiently without a major hassle of regrinding big gear.
Skilling will benefit from the high def & I can grind harder towards finals.
Sticking with the 36-70 Combat Bracket AFTER gaining Piety/unlocking MM1 for D-Scim.
Aiming for Combat Level 70

10x XP in all skills, plus 15x in my bracket I'm aiming at for Combat Only.

Combat Stats I'm shooting for:

	1 Attack (1 for Bone Dagger P+ in Dorg for spec)
	75 Strength (30 Addy WH, 40 Rune WH, 60 D-WH, Max DPS)
	70 Defense (Piety, most armorsets (Neizy Helm), best for skilling route)
	50 Ranged (28 for Dorg Cbow, 40 Green Dhide, 50 Magic Shortbow, 50 Accumulator, 50 Blue Dhide, )
	70 Prayer (Piety)
	50 Magic (35 for Fire Bolt, Family Crest gives Chaos Gauntlets for max 15 hit, 50 Iban's Blast)
