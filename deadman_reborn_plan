DEADMAN REBORN PLAN

I'm considering playing a 70 Defense/Piety Pure. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Defence_Pure
Goal is learning PvP more efficiently without a major hassle of regrinding big gear.
Skilling will benefit from the high def & I can grind harder towards finals.
Sticking with the 36-70 Combat Bracket AFTER gaining Piety/unlocking MM1 for D-Scim.
Aiming for Combat Level 70

10x XP in all skills, plus 15x in my bracket I'm aiming at for Combat Only.

Combat Stats I'm shooting for:

	1 Attack (1 for Bone Dagger P+ in Dorg for spec)
	75 Strength (30 Addy WH, 40 Rune WH, 60 D-WH, Max DPS)
	70 Defense (Piety, most armorsets (Neizy Helm), best for skilling route)
	50 Ranged (28 for Dorg Cbow, 40 Green Dhide, 50 Magic Shortbow, 50 Accumulator, 50 Blue Dhide, )
	70 Prayer (Piety)
	50 Magic (35 for Fire Bolt, Family Crest gives Chaos Gauntlets for max 15 hit, 50 Iban's Blast)

Quests: The following automatic unlocks will apply. Rush King's Ransom for Piety

Upon starting a new account at Level 3:

	Ernest the Chicken
	Goblin Diplomacy
	Rune Mysteries
	Shield of Aarav
	Recipe for Disaster Part 1
	Druidic Ritual and Level 3 Herblore

Upon reaching Level 36-70 worlds:

	Tree Gnome Village
	Priest in Peril
	Animal Magnetism
	Increase the access of the Culinaromancer's chest to Adamant Gloves
	100% Zeah favour
	The ‘Bigger and Badder’ Slayer perk



*Lots of DPS calculations will need to occur.*

Notes Section:
Boaty 45 minutes to get Dorg Cbow, Green Dhide chaps, Green Dhide Vambs, studded body, Highway cape, Coif, anti d shield

Look up 1 def pure, piety pure

On last life, suicide to a friend to save your items
Solomission pointed out a good first quest can be Witch's House will grant 63,250xp (45HP+), good before MM1 prob
Sigil meta will be log in, choose Stamina sigil, do your quests & running around stuff, reset & choose a combat related one
Train with Event RPG from Diango for early Defense training
Magic AT LEAST 58 for High Alching? Will it be necessary? I was thinking 60 for Flames of Zammy
