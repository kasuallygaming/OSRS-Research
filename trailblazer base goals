***MY BASE GOALS***

Main Goals are reaching Max Cape, then work towards Pets, as they transfer from League to League.

Area Unlocks in order: Asgarnia, Kandarin, Fremmenik.

Currently working on an efficient Misthalin/Karamja circuit to gain the most out of the starting areas. That includes:
  -Early Quests that can be done within starting regions, including quests that become cancelled when unlocking another region
  -Achievement Diary tasking, as they will most likely be Tasks to complete. They also provide good XP.
  -Certain skilling points need to be achieved to get the ball rolling on other skills (ex. Birdhouses).

Keeping my levels balanced is another big goal of mine & fighting Total Level HiScores. But as we saw with Equalibrium, it may have it's own advantages.

I'll be working through Achievement Diaries through Medium-Hard if needed, but I'd like to save those XP drops for 16X XP if possible. Most likely towards Herblore.

Another big XP farm may be the Varrock Museum (if we get to update the upper displays). Waiting until 16x XP is key to update them.

To avoid burnout, I'll be working on skills 5-10 levels at a time towards the top of the skill caps. When 90's roll around, possibly less.

For PvM content, I'm not 100% on what I want to do. Thermonuclear Smoke Devil is a pet I'd like to obtain.

I'll update this when I add/change goals. More Advanced Lists to come, so check those out soon!
